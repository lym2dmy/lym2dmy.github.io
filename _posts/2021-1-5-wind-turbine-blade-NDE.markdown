# Abstract
> Wind energy, with an exponential growth in the last years, is nowadays one of the most important renewable energy sources. Modern wind turbines are bigger and complex to produce more energy. This industry requires to reduce its operating and maintenance costs and to increase its reliability, safety, maintainability and availability. Condition monitoring systems are beginning to be employed for this purpose. They must be reliable and cost-effective to reduce the long periods of downtimes and high maintenance costs, and to avoid catastrophic scenarios caused by undetected failures. This paper presents a survey about the most important and updated condition monitoring techniques based on non-destructive testing and methods applied to wind turbine blades. In addition, it analyses the future trends and challenges of structural health monitoring systems in wind turbine blades.

# Comments
1. The reviewed NDE methods inlcuded Visual testing, Ultrasonic testing, Thermography testing, Radiographic testing, Electromagnetic testing (ET), Acoustic emission testing, Shearography testing, and Other NDT testing.
2. Different methods sumarrized as follows:
3. Visual inspection presents low accuracy regarding to other non-destructive techniques. Visual inspections of wind turbine blades are not easy because of the high height of them. Visual inspection does not detect internal faults. Cameras with big zoom or digital cameras with long range lenses are used for visual inspection, together with devices embedded in unmanned aerial vehicles.
4. Ultrasonic techniques are the most employed in wind turbine blades. They have demonstrated robustness and accuracy for fault detection and diagnosis, both internal and external faults to the surface.
5. Passive thermography can monitor wind turbine blades from the ground in wind turbine operation. Heat flows caused by periodic loading and faulty areas can be analysed with this technique. Active thermography needs thermal excitation.
6. X-ray testing transmits ionizing radiation into a material and its attenuation is measured for fault detection. The X-ray allows the detection of internal faults such as cracks, thickness variations, corrosion, etc. It can be used in 2D or with 3D mode tomography.
7. Electromagnetic testing is a non-contact technique with high resolution. It has great impact as a non-destructive technique for detection in metal components.
8. Acoustic emission allows to detect and identify damages in wind turbine blades. A large number of studies have shown the efficiency of this method.
9. Shearography is able to detect surface deformation. The efficiency depends on the size and location of the faults. The technique is being employed due to the technological advances done in cameras, laser sensors and hardware.


# Questions
1. This paper is too simple, and do not like a review with deepth. I don't know how it is published.
2. Section 3 was named "Structural health monitoring and WTB". I don't know how is NDE related to SHM. They are two things. But the authors mixed them up.
