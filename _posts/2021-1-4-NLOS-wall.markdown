# Abstract
> Ultra-Wideband technology provides accurate localization in indoor environments using time-of-arrival based ranging techniques; however, the positioning accuracy is degraded by non-line-of-sight conditions. In this work, the relation between the non-line-of-sight path length error and the obstacles on the path from transmitter to receiver is used as input to a new positioning algorithm to correct the corrupted measurements. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in positioning accuracy as compared to line-of-sight algorithms.
