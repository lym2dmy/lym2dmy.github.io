# Abstract
> This paper presents a brief review on major accidents and conducts bibliometric analysis of risk assessment methods for excavation system in recent year. The summarization of potential risks during excavation provides an important index for establishing an early warning system. The applications of fuzzy set theory and machine learning methods in risk assessment during excavation are presented. A case study of excavation in Guangzhou metro station is used to demonstrate the application of a machine learning method for risk evaluation. The large amount of data collected by 3S techniques (RS, GIS and GPS) and sensors increases accuracy of risk assessment levels in excavation. These procedures, integrated into building information modelling (BIM) management platform, can manipulate dynamic safety risk monitoring, control, and management. Finally, the processing and analysis of big data obtained from 3S techniques and sensors provide promising perspectives for establishing integrated technology system for excavation.

# Comments
1. P1: Describe the importance of subway and excavation. (The underground space is in great demand, owing to the rapid development of cities.)
2. P1: Introduce the accidents in urban deep excavation using a table.
3. P1: Point out the content of this paper. (It is urgent to apply certain methods to predict the risk of deep excavation in subway stations.)
4. P2: There are many types of methods to do the thing (risk assessment), however, machine learning based methods are more suitable.
5. P3: State the content and objectives of the review. (This paper presents an overview of the methodologies for excavation risk assessment and several techniques applied in the risk management of deep excavation. The objectives of this paper are to (i) provide a review of current research on deep excavation risk assessment methods; (ii) compare existing methods (such as fuzzy set theory and machine learning) for potential risk assessment of deep excavation; and (iii) discuss technical countermeasures incorporating the latest technology, such as building information modelling (BIM), global positioning system (GPS), remote sensing (RS) and geological information system (GIS) to maintain sustainability of the construction of deep excavation.)
